    <h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>

    <p>I was just curious during Coronavirus and decided to see how much it would cost to make a static website.</p>

    <p>So far I've paid 9 dollars for my domain name, Albert Farrales. The hosting is completely free courtesy of Netfliy. (Not Sponsored)</p>

    <p>The HTML, CSS and JavaScript in this template are extremely minimal, which makes the code easy to build on top of or replace completely.</p>

    <h2 id="test">Asset Compilation Test</h2>

    <p>CSS test: <span class="test-css">text with blue border</span></p>

    <p>JavaScript test: <a href="#test" class="test-js">click me</a></p>
