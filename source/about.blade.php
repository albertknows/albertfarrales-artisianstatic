    <h1>About</h1>

    <p>My name is Albert Farrales and I'm currently 19 years old. I'm a senior about to graduate in two quarters. After college I plan to move to Seattle and hopefully start a career in IT. So far I have an internship as an Account Manager at OMT Enterprises Inc. and am attending classes online.</p>
